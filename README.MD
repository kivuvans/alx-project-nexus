## 🏗 Core Backend Concepts Learned

### 📂 Database Design
- Relational modeling with PostgreSQL
- Django ORM
- Indexing and query optimization

### ⚡ Asynchronous Programming
- Background tasks with Celery
- Message brokers (RabbitMQ, Redis)
- Improving performance with async execution

### 🚀 Caching Strategies
- View-level caching
- Low-level caching using Redis
- Cache invalidation with Django signals
- Performance analysis using cache metrics

### 🔐 Security & Analytics
- IP logging and tracking
- IP blacklisting
- Rate limiting

- Anomaly detection

---

## 🧩 Challenges Faced & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance Bottlenecks
**Solution:**  
Implemented Redis caching and query optimization to reduce database load.

### Challenge 2: Background Task Reliability
**Solution:**  
Used Celery with message brokers to handle asynchronous jobs like email notifications.

### Challenge 3: Deployment Complexity
**Solution:**  
Adopted Docker and cloud platforms (PythonAnywhere / Render) for consistent deployments.

### Challenge 4: Security & Abuse Prevention
**Solution:**  
Implemented IP tracking, rate limiting, and anomaly detection using middleware and Celery tasks.

---

## ✅ Best Practices & Key Takeaways
- Always separate configuration using environment variables
- Cache aggressively but invalidate correctly
- Use background tasks for time-consuming operations
- Document APIs clearly using Swagger
- Monitor application behavior and performance continuously
- Security should be proactive, not reactive
